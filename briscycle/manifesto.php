                Manifesto
Every old bike deserves and new lease of life and thereâ€™s one with your name on it. We take in the well-ridden, the once loved and the weather-beaten bicycles of this great city and give them a new lease of life. Make us your first stop for a wide range of reconditioned, restored and resurrected cycles of all shapes and sizes. Whatever your fancy, we can supply a cycle restored sympathetically to the highest standards and specifications. Our recycled cycles were better built and are more than fit for purpose, giving you access to unique, safe and smart cycling. Share this:
